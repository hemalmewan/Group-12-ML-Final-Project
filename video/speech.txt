Hello and welcome to Furnish AI — your intelligent furniture companion that blends design, technology, and artificial intelligence to transform how you shop for furniture. Furnish AI isn’t just a website — it’s a smart platform built to help you explore furniture effortlessly, understand delivery reliability, and make confident purchasing decisions. Let’s take a quick tour of our application.

First, let’s begin with the Dataset Overview.
Our dataset forms the backbone of Furnish Ai's delivery prediction system, containing 1,938 detailed furniture delivery records across 14 key attributes, including product details, pricing, shipping, assembly, and customer ratings.
We simplified six original delivery outcomes into three categories — Delivered, Failed Delivery, and Ongoing — improving both accuracy and clarity.
These insights helped us build models that enhance logistics reliability and support smarter business decisions.

Next, under the About section, we share our vision — to create a seamless connection between customers and smart furniture technology. Furnish AI enhances every shopping journey with AI-driven insights, bringing comfort, transparency, and trust to every purchase.

In the Delivery Methods section, we showcase how our logistics system works. We offer standard, express, and scheduled delivery with optional home assembly.
Our AI monitors routes, delivery partners, and regional conditions in real time to ensure on-time and reliable delivery predictions.

Moving on to what we offer — Furnish AI features an extensive range of products: sofas, office chairs, dining sets, wardrobes, and even smart, space-saving modular furniture.
We also promote eco-friendly designs and seasonal discounts to give customers more value and sustainability.

Now, the heart of our project — the AI Delivery Prediction System.
We trained several models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Tree and AdaBoost, but our top performer was the AdaBoost Classifier, delivering the best accuracy in predicting delivery outcomes.

Finally, let’s look at our Prediction Form.
Users can enter their order details and instantly see their predicted delivery status.

demonstration example 01:After clicking Predict, the system quickly returns the result — ‘Delivered’ — meaning the order is likely to reach the customer on time. This shows how efficient and reliable our AI model is for confident decision-making.”

demonstration example 02:Once we hit Predict, the model displays the result — ‘Failed Delivery’, indicating a potential issue such as delivery delay or customer rejection. This allows businesses to take preventive actions before problems occur — saving both time and customer satisfaction.”

At Furnish AI, our commitment goes beyond technology — it’s about trust, innovation, and sustainability.
Our talented team — Hemal, the Full Stack Developer behind the elegant interface, and Maheesha, the Data Scientist powering the AI models — proudly built this system from the ground up.
